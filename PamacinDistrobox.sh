# This script automates the setup of a persistent, GUI-based package management
# system (Pamac with AUR) on SteamOS using Distrobox.
# It is idempotent and fully automated, requiring no user input after execution.
#
# WHY THIS DOES NOT REQUIRE DEVELOPER MODE:
# This script is carefully designed to work on a standard Steam Deck (SteamOS 3.5+).
# 1. It checks for Podman/Distrobox, which are pre-installed by Valve. It does NOT try to install them on the host.
# 2. All container files are stored in the user's home directory, which is always writable.
# 3. App exports (.desktop files) and Flatpak installs are user-level operations that do not touch the read-only system root.
